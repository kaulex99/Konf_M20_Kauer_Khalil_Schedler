# About Konf_M20_Kauer_Khalil_Schedler (Drinks)

Educational project for the configuration management course.

## Getting started

The project uses maven as build tool.

To get started simply clone or download the project
from [here](https://github.com/kaulex99/Konf_M20_Kauer_Khalil_Schedler).  
After that you have 2 options:

1. Use an IDE like IntelliJ
2. Use the terminal

### 1. Using an IDE

If you open the project the first time most IDE's will detect the pom.xml an ask if you want to import the maven
project. Simply click yes and the IDE will do some magic for you.  
You then can start the maven lifecycles from your IDE

### 2. Using the good old Terminal

First you need to have installed a JDK and Maven (check with `javac --version` and `mvn --version`)  
Open the terminal and navigate into the projects root folder (folder which contains the pom.xml). There you can then
start the maven lifecycles with the mvn command using the lifecycle name (e.g. `mvn test`)
